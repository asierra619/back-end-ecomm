# E-commerce Back End

## Description

The E-Commerce Inventory project was created in order to help business owners and stockers to maintain a better sense of their inventory on a digital tool. 

This project helped me become much more comfortable with express and routes, as well as MySQL and Sequelize with models and their associated data as well.
